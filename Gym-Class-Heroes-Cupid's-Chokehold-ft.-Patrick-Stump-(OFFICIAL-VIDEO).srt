1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,900
Take a look at my girlfriend

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
She's the only one I got

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,900
Not much of a girlfriend

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I never seem to get a lot

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,300
It's been some time since
we've last spoke

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,000
This is gonna sound like a bad joke

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,100
But Momma, I fell in love again

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,200
It's safe to say I have
a new girlfriend

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,800
And I know it sounds so old

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,600
But Cupid got me in a chokehold

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,150
And I'm afraid I might give in

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,400
Towel's on the mat, my
white flag is wavin'

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,750
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,000
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,000
If that ain't love then I
don't know what love is

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,700
We even got a secret handshake

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,300
And she loves the music
that my band makes

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,800
I know I'm young, but if I had
to choose her or the sun

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,200
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,900
Take a look at my girlfriend

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,900
She's the only one I got

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,200
Not much of a girlfriend

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,000
I never seem to get a lot

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,200
Take a look at my girlfriend

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,600
She's the only one I got

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,200
Not much of a girlfriend

27
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,300
I never seem to get a lot

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,700
It's been a while since we talked last

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,100
And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,300
But Dad, I'm finally thinkin'
I may have found the one

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,900
Type of girl that'll make you
way proud of your son

32
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,700
And I know you heard the last song

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,200
About the girls that didn't last long

34
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,400
But I promise this is
on a whole new plane

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,000
I can tell by the way she says my name

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,550
I love the way she calls my phone

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,400
She's even got her very own ringtone

38
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,900
If that ain't love then I
don't know what love is

39
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,600
It's gonna be a long drive home

40
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,100
But I know as soon as I arrive home

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,800
And I open the door, take off my coat,
and throw my bag on the floor

42
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,900
She'll be back into my arms
once more for sure like

43
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,700
Take a look at my girlfriend

44
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,600
She's the only one I got

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,600
Not much of a girlfriend

46
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,500
I never seem to get a lot

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,600
Take a look at my girlfriend

48
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,900
She's the only one I got

49
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,600
Not much of a girlfriend

50
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,800
I never seem to get a lot

51
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,800
She's got a smile that'll
make the most senile

52
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,700
Annoying old man bite his
tongue (I'm not done)

53
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,400
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise

54
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
And it doesn't stop there
(Man I swear)

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,500
She's got porcelain skin,
of course she's a ten

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,350
Now she's even got her own
song (But movin on)

57
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
She's got the cutest laugh
I've ever heard

58
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,200
And we can be on the phone for three
hours (Not sayin' one word)

59
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,600
And I would still cherish every moment

60
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,700
And when I start to build my future,
she's the main component

61
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,000
Call it (dumb), call it
(luck), call it (love)

62
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,000
Or whatever you call it, but

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,200
Everywhere I go I keep her
picture in my wallet like

64
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,800
Take a look at my girlfriend

65
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,400
She's the only one I got

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,800
Not much of a girlfriend

67
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,100
I never seem to get a lot

68
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,800
Take a look at my girlfriend

69
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,200
She's the only one I got

70
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,900
Not much of a girlfriend

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,400
I never seem to get a lot

72
